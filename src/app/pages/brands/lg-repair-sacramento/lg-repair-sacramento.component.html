      <p class="font-size-md">LG is one of the most trusted home appliance brands. It was established in
        1958 as a Goldstar. Later in 1995 Goldstar merged with Lucky changing the corporate name Lucky-Goldstar, and
        then finally LG electronics. Today LG produces high quality household appliances such as refrigerators, washers,
        dryers, dishwashers, microwaves, stoves, ovens and more. Regardless of their quality, most appliances will
        eventually need some form of repair. If you need LG appliance repair service, just contact <strong>LG Repair
          Sacramento</strong>, and your appliance will work as new in no time!
